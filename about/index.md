The Katherine Anne Porter Correspondence Project makes over 5,000 pages of newly digitized correspondence available online and provides unprecedented access to the ideas, attitudes, and experiences this distinguished 20th Century writer shared with her family members.  The correspondence has been drawn from the University of Maryland Libraries’ Katherine Anne Porter Papers and other supporting collections, and this collaboration between the Libraries’ Special Collections and Digital Stewardship units has been supported by a grant from the Katherine Anne Porter Literary trust.

The goals of the Katherine Anne Porter Correspondence Project are as follows:

1.	To expand Porter’s published oeuvre by making her archived writings available to the public

2.	To enrich Porter scholarship through sharing her own documentation of her life, work, and personal relationships

3.	To invite new consideration of the major 20th century cultural and historical events she experienced

<!-- *	{we might want to add a goal about its contribution to digitization efforts} -->

#### Expanding Porter’s Oeuvre
Although Porter’s collection of published writings is relatively modest for a writer of her caliber, the archive of correspondence she preserved and donated to the University of Maryland is abundant.  In these letters, she writes about her frustrations with publishers and reveals an awareness that her personal correspondence may someday be of interest to the general public.  The online publication of these letters makes Porter’s work accessible in a way that could not have been imagined during her lifetime.   The Katherine Anne Porter [digital edition] enriches the study of 20th Century literary history by making available the important content and skillful form of these letters while utilizing 21st Century tools for publishing and accessing them.

#### Documenting Porter’s Life, Work, and Personal Relationships
The project includes correspondence with nearly thirty of Porter’s individual family members.  These include her sister, Gay Porter Hollaway, two of her husbands, Eugene Pressly and Albert Erskine, and her beloved niece and nephew, Ann Hollaway Heintze and Paul Porter Jr. In these letters, Porter discusses her life experiences, demonstrates her attitudes toward the arts, and documents her writing habits and artistic preoccupations. As a result, this correspondence provides contexts and resources for the study of Porter’s life, her previously published work, and her relationships with these intimate confidants.

#### Inviting New Consideration of Major 20th Century Events
These letters feature Porter’s frequent ruminations on the major historical and cultural events she experienced. Porter lived in Mexico during the time of political upheaval that followed the Mexican Revolution, among artists in New York City throughout the 1920s, in Germany when the Nazis were beginning to gain power, in Paris with other expatriates in the 1930s, and in Washington, D.C. during World War II and the administrations of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson.  Porter’s friends and acquaintances included fellow writers, publishers, artists, cultural figures, and politicians. Porter’s insights about these events as they were happening and as she reflected on them later in life invite new consideration of their historical and cultural significance.
