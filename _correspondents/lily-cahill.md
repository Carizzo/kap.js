Gertrude Cahill Beitel, Lily Cahill, and Helen Greenwell were sisters and second cousins of  Katherine Anne. Their mother, Virginia Myers Cahill, was the daughter of Eliza Jane Skaggs Myers, a sister of Catherine Ann Skaggs Porter, Katherine Anne’s paternal grandmother.  Although they were distant cousins, Katherine Anne felt a familial bond with the sisters, corresponding with and visiting them when she could.

Lily Cahill had a successful career as an actress, both on Broadway and in films.  While only a few letters to Lily remain, they document Katherine Anne’s sympathy for Lily’s health ailments and her confidence that Lily was a fellow artist.  Katherine Anne’s letters to Gertrude  following Lily’s death in 1955 also describe what Lily meant to her.
