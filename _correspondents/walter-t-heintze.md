Walter T. Heintze was the second husband of Katherine Anneâ€™s niece, Ann Hollaway Heintze.  He was an industrial designer who emigrated to the United States from Sweden. Ann and Walter Heintze wed in 1950, and their sons David and Donald were born in 1952 and 1954.  Katherine Anne often addressed Walter warmly in the family correspondence and sent him individual cards to accompany those she sent to his wife and sons.  In her letters to Ann, however, Porter criticizes Walter and assures her niece she deserves better treatment.
