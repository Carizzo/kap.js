Gay Porter Holloway was Katherine Anne’s older sister and closest confidante for the duration of her life.   Gay married Thomas H. Holloway in a 1916 double ceremony with Katherine Anne and her first husband, John Koontz.  Katherine Anne was also very close to Gay’s two daughters, Mary Alice Holl0way (1912-1919) and Ann Holloway Heintze (1921-1987) and helped care for Gay after the birth of Gay’s son, Thomas Harry Holloway (1914-1951). 

Katherine Anne dedicated *The Days Before* (1952) to her beloved older sister.  The letters Katherine Anne wrote to Gay provide the most intimate look into her feelings over the longest span of her life.  They document her experiences, feelings, relationships, struggles, and successes.  Their discussions of family matters often reveal Katherine Anne’s contentious attitude toward other family members, further emphasizing the warm regard she held for Gay.
