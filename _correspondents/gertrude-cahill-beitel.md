Gertrude Cahill Beitel, Lily Cahill, and Helen Greenwell were sisters and second cousins of  Katherine Anne. Their mother, Virginia Myers Cahill, was the daughter of Eliza Jane Skaggs Myers, a sister of Catherine Ann Skaggs Porter, Katherine Anne’s paternal grandmother.  Although they were distant cousins, Katherine Anne felt a familial bond with the sisters, corresponding with and visiting them when she could.

The archived letters reveal that they kept up a regular correspondence throughout the 1950s in which Katherine Anne discusses Gertrude’s writing, her own writing and thoughts about literature, social events, and their family connections.  The letters written in 1955 also offer sympathy for Lily’s death and document Katherine Anne’s grief about Gertrude’s loss.
