Gertrude Cahill Beitel, Lily Cahill, and Helen Greenwell were sisters and second cousins of  Katherine Anne. Their mother, Virginia Myers Cahill, was the daughter of Eliza Jane Skaggs Myers, a sister of Catherine Ann Skaggs Porter, Katherine Anne’s paternal grandmother.  Although they were distant cousins, Katherine Anne felt a familial bond with the sisters, corresponding with and visiting them when she could.

In the archived letters to Helen Greenwell from the 1950s, Katherine Anne describes the gathering momentum of her career, reflects on childhood memories, and discusses family matters, including the decline of Gertrude Beitel’s health and her death. The letters often include greetings for Helen’s husband, Sam Greenwell, as well.
