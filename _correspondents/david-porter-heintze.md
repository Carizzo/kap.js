David Porter Heintze and Donald Boone Heintze are Katherine Anneâ€™s great nephews, the sons of her niece Ann Hollaway Heintze.  Katherine Anne was charmed to be named the godmother of David, and, when David and Donald were young children, Katherine Anne often sent them postcards documenting her extensive travels and greeting cards to commemorate holidays.  These frequent notes capture the warm affection Porter held for her  great nephews and her desire to participate in their upbringing and education.
