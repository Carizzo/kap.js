Paris was Porterâ€™s primary residence from February 1932 through October 1936.  She spent the majority of this time living with Eugene Pressly, whom she married in March 1933.  During this period, she did travel elsewhere for extended periods of time, including Switzerland and the United States.

She returned to Paris from May until September 1952 in order to attend the Congress of Cultural Freedom in Paris.  During June of that year, she also visited Pont-Aven in Brittany.
In February 1955, Porter visited Cannes and Nice, before she left Belgium for the U.S.

Porter also resided in Paris from June through October 1963.
